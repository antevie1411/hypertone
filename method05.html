            <br>
            <p>Here's a little rundown of the technique known as Breaking.</p>

            <p>On the 4th of July, TofpFL (ThatOneFLProd) discovered a technique of Hypertone that can be achieved via FL Studio. This technique is called: Audio Clip Manipulation. It kind of works just how breaking works but without the complicated stuff. For example: We will use 522 BPM (FL Studio's BPM Limit) to demonstrate this. We will take 4 whole notes and it matches perfectly with 522 BPM. Then by duplicating the 4 whole notes into 4 bars, then scaling them down to one bar again, we get 16th notes. (OR: 522*4 = 2044) This technique requires a pretty powerful PC because you will need to have 768 PPQ (You can use 960 for different BPMs in a singular BPM), and 4/16 time division to get the number we're about to reach. After doing that 4 times, we have 133,632 BPM. We cannot scale the notes further down, so we will export the pattern you've reached 133,632 BPM and will duplicate the audio clip so its 2x the length. Then you turn down the pitch by -1200 cents, (A whole octave) then export that again and speed it up. It will go by +1 octave meaning it will sound exactly similar to what you would get if you had unlimited PPQ and scaling. Which gets us to 267,264. Using the audio manipulation technique again, we get 534,528, 1,069,056 (Close to 1.2M+), and 2138112 BPM. Making a tone which the human ear cannot perceive unless you add FX to distort said tone. Thus, is Hypertone. This also invents the new form of Hypertone: FL Hypertone. </p>
