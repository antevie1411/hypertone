            <p>Here's a little rundown of hypertone's history.</p>

            <p>Hypertone is a subgenre of Extratone ranging from 1,200,000 BPM to infinity, denoting the point at which tones become ultrasonic or aliased. The genre was created by Zustand D. in 2013 with the release of "Introduxia Dimensii Hypertone", with further releases adding BPM specifications shortly after.</p>

                    <p class="history_caption">Introduxia Dimensii Hypertone, the first hypertone track.</p>
                </div>
            <p>Words from Zustand D. about the track Introduxia Dimensii Hypertone :</p>
                <p class="quote">Little fun facts : The original track is hardware only, it is a very hot mixerless feedback loop between a Sherman Filterbank 2, KP3, analog delay, A-B switcher, I cant recall all small details, but at some point I started to get signal flows which were defying any logic. The analog delay was on a deactivated output of the A-B switcher, but it somehow had to be there because it affacted the sound just being plugged in there, which is a bit nonsensical in terms of signal flow. I played the track as it is in one go in an improvised session, no editing, no overdubs, just added the vocal sample in the beginning afterwards.
                The KP3 got fried in the process, half of the touch pad turned black and it became rather disfunctional after. Recorded straight into RME interface into Cubase DAW. I was not able to export the track, as it always sounded degraded or evened out the aliasing effects, which was unknown to me from any other track I did. So I hooked up a Sound Devices recorder directly to the stereo out of the RME interface and recorded straight into it, which luckily gave me a satisfying result, preserving all the depth of aliasing artifacts.</p>
            <p>At BPM levels this high, many practical and physical limitations arise surrounding playability and audibility. The 20 kHz limit of human hearing is reached, consumer audio sample rates can no longer accurately represent the waveforms produced, and most speaker diaphragms are incapable of moving fast enough to accurately reproduce such rapid transients.</p>
            <p>As a result, hypertone producers utilize various workarounds involving aliasing as a form of intentional distortion, displacing the audio back into playable and audible frequency ranges. However, it is important to note that ultratone (unaliased hypertone) continues to push into the ultrasonic frequency range.</p>
            <p>As opposed to other forms of extratone that have an exact equivalence between BPM and frequency, hypertone's relationship between the two differs depending on the sample rate used. If the BPM's relative frequency in hertz is higher than the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate), it will be aliased. To calculate this aliasing, take the ultrasonic frequency modulo the sample rate, and if the resulting value still exceeds the Nyquist frequency, subtract it from the sample rate.</p>
            <p>Due to the methods used to create the genre, hypertone tracks typically feature sporadic structures and sudden jumps between audible and inaudible sound. Unlike other Speedcore subgenres, hypertone tends to have less overt Hardcore [EDM] influence, sounding more like Drone or Noise music. Themes of science fiction, particularly of outer space, commonly show up as conceptual bases for hypertone projects.</p>
