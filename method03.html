            <p>Here's a little rundown of the technique known as Breaking.</p>

            <p>Also in April 2021, an artist called Man In A Coffin discovered a method called Rebuilding. Which is also a Cyclic Hypertone Technique, which delays the need for amplification 10+ times. Man In A Coffin ran a few tests on how many times will Rebuilding speed up a tone before the need of amplification, and the answer of those tests were 2 to 3 times. </p>
