            <br>
            <p>Here's a little rundown of the technique known as Breaking.</p>

            <p>Then there's a method discovered in June 2020 by Vortex Reaper, called 'Breaking'. The difference between Breaking and Speeding Up On Itself is that Breaking is a cycle that can be repeated infinitely, whilst Speeding Up On Itself isn't. The maximum BPM that Speeding Up On Itself has reached was e+1001 BPM. In the e+1001 BPM track, the sound is almost destroyed entirely. With Breaking, you can split the sound into segments, then speed that up to revive the tone. </p>
            <p>On November 23rd, 2020, a basic tutorial for how to do Breaking was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvI3Og0jSLU">published on YouTube.</a></p>
            <p>Later on, Breaking got more different forms, because you can zoom in in Audacity.</p>
            <p>There are seven current forms of Breaking: Breaking, Micro-Breaking, Nano-Breaking, Pico-Breaking, Femto-Breaking, Yocto-Breaking and Zepto-Breaking. </p>
            <p>Zepto-Breaking is currently the smallest form there is, after it was discovered in an attempt to see if Femto-Breaking was a possible form to exist, because at the time, in early December 2020, Femto-Breaking was considered theoretical. As a result of this discovery, Vortex Reaper went on to research further and understand it more clearly. </p>
            <p>Zepto-Breaking is so small that you are separating the sound particles of the tone. </p>
            <p>Also in early 2021, Ij9j9j9j99j9 created a technique using macros and an external coding software, enabling the creation of LARGE speed multipliers, however, since he faked his BPMs on more than one occasion, it quickly fell out of fashion</p>
            <p>On the 27th of March, 2021, the most major text revolving around Breaking was published on Vortex Reaper's ee+1001 BPM track 'Far Beyond The Omega Gods, Far Beyond Everything In Existence From Within This Reality'. The link is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg0dp7K3uGA">here.</a></p>
            <p>At BPM levels this high, many practical and physical limitations arise surrounding playability and audibility. The 20 kHz limit of human hearing is reached, consumer audio sample rates can no longer accurately represent the waveforms produced, and most speaker diaphragms are incapable of moving fast enough to accurately reproduce such rapid transients.</p>
